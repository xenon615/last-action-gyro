## Will a gyroscope implemented using Avian3D be able to keep an object in a vertical position?  
Everyone knows that a spinning flywheel has a gyroscopic effect, meaning it tends to maintain its position in space.
Okay, so that works in real life. I'd be interested to see if we can achieve the same effect using Avian3D?
